This may indicate that the structure of Wikidata does not have a direct \"appeared in TV show\" property, or it is not indexed or used explicitly for this purpose.\n\nInstead, actors are typically linked to media via **\"filmography\"** (a list of works) or via **\"production company\"**, **\"episode\"**, or **\"appearance\"** properties. However, there is no explicit \"appeared in TV show\" property.\n\nI will now search for entities (TV shows) associated with Shagun Sharma, using a more general query: searching for TV shows that feature actors, with Shagun Sharma as an actor. I will use `search_object_of_property` to find objects (TV shows) that are linked to an actor, with a property related to participation.\n\nLet me search for TV shows that actors are known to appear in, by first finding properties like \"film or television appearance\" or \"appeared in\".", "tool_calls": [{"id": "chatcmpl-tool-cc4572214dea4a90b661b41a5497bfac", "name": "search_property", "args": {"kg": "wikidata", "query": "appeared in"}, "result": "Top 10 property alternatives:\n1. present in work (wd:P1441 as wdt/psn/pqv/ps/wdtn/pr/prn/p/psv/prv/pqn/pq, matched via appeared in), also known as appeared in, appears in, appears in work, character in, featured in work, etc.: this (fictional or fictionalized) entity, place, or person ...
