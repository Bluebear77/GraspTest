Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4.

It is unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead.\n- Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n- The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n- Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n- Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n- For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who set the fastest average in Megaminx?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"id": "522b9cf7d6d443feb123ea24211285c6", "message": "To determine who set the fastest average in a Megaminx, I need to understand the relevant entities and properties in the knowledge graph.\n\nStep 1: Identify relevant entities and concepts.\n- The Megaminx is a type of puzzle cube.
