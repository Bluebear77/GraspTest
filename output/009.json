To fix this, I must avoid reusing the variable in the `FILTER`. Instead, I can directly use the `rdfs:label` in the filter without assigning it as an output.\n\nThe correct way is to query for the entity with the label containing \"carbon-14\" without creating a separate alias for the label in the `SELECT` clause. I will adjust the query as follows:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?isotope\nWHERE {\n  ?isotope wdt:P31 wd:Q25276 .\n  ?isotope rdfs:label ?label .\n  FILTER(CONTAINS(STR(?label), 'carbon-14'))\n}\n```\n\nThis will retrieve the isotope entity directly based on its label containing \"carbon-14\".\n</tool_call>\n{\"name\": \"execute\", \"arguments\": {\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"sparql\": \"SELECT ?isotope WHERE { ?isotope wdt:P31 wd:Q25276 . ?isotope rdfs:label ?label . FILTER(CONTAINS(STR(?label), 'carbon-14')) }\"}}\n</tool_call>", "tool_calls": [], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 270, "prompt_tokens": 7703, "total_tokens": 7973}}}], "known":
