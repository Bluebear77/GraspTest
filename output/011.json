Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAvailable knowledge graphs:\n- wikidata at https://qlever.dev/api/wikidata with prefix index for entities and similarity index for properties\n\nIndex types used for entities and properties:\n- Prefix index: Retrieves items by overlap between query keywords and item words.

When the task input is incomplete or ambiguous, proceed based on reasonable assumptions.\n- Do not use \"SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...\" in SPARQL queries. It is unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead.\n- Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n- The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n- Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n- Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n- For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which two railway stations does the Yunoyama Line connect?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"id": "987d9009cd654e79ac53b35f677f0a2d", "message": "To determine which two railway stations the Yunoyama Line connects, I need to identify relevant entities and properties connected to the Yunoyama Line in Wikidata.\n\nStep 1: First, I will search for the \"Yunoyama Line\" in Wikidata to find its entity identifier (IRI).\n\nI will use the `search_entity` function to search for the Yunoyama Line.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "chatcmpl-tool-b939801dc9ae4edda78c647d83eefddb", "name": "search_entity", "args": {"kg": "wikidata", "query": "Yunoyama Line"}, "result": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.
