Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead.\n- Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n- The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n- Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n- Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n- For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What were the voting results of the 1975 North Vietnamese legislative election with regards to seats?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"id": "ad3a0df827c24f3db93995ba686a987f", "message": "The question asks about the voting results of the 1975 North Vietnamese legislative election, specifically regarding seats. \n\nStep 1: Understand the context\n- \"North Vietnamese legislative election\" refers to an election in North Vietnam (now part of Vietnam). \n- \"Voting results with regards to seats\" implies we are looking for information about how seats were distributed or allocated in the election.\n\nStep 2: Identify relevant knowledge graph\n- Wikidata is a knowledge graph that contains information about historical events, political entities, and elections.\n\nStep 3: Search for relevant entities and properties\n- We need to find information related to the \"1975 North Vietnamese legislative election.\"\n- We will first check if entities related to such an election exist in Wikidata.\n\nStep 4: Search for an election-related entity\n- I will search for entities related to \"1975 North Vietnamese legislative election\" using the entity search function.\n\nNote: It is important to verify if such an election is well documented in Wikidata.
