Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions.

It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n- Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n- Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n- For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query."}, {"role": "user", "content": "When and in which club and league did Kazunari Okayama start his career?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"id": "362b4baa28d14f6d94d2cc70873f1389", "message": "To determine when Kazunari Okayama started his career, and in which club and league, I need to:\n\n1.
