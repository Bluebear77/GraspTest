Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions.

Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead.\n- Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n- The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n- Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n- Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n- For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What seasons did Faye appear for Hull City?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"id": "293a43d8492b4ec7938fc3e8a3c7fc0e", "message": "To determine the seasons in which Faye appeared for Hull City, I first need to identify the relevant entities and relationships in the knowledge graph.
