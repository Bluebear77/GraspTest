Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which distinct female individuals were either born or died in Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, and who died before January 1, 1948?

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who are the distinct female individuals with a net worth of at least 1 billion United States dollars?

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many unmarried partners do male and female creative and performing artists have, respectively?

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who are the individual goats that have served as the mascot \"Billygoat Hennes\" for 1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the men's singles tennis events that do not have a winner indicated and are part of a tournament that belongs to either the ATP Tour or the Grand Prix tennis circuit?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1. **Target entities:** Men's singles tennis events.\n2. **Properties:**\n   - Event type: Should be \"men's singles\" (need to find the correct entity for this).\n   - Belongs to a tournament that is part of either the ATP Tour or the Grand Prix tennis circuit (need to find entities for these circuits and the property linking events to tournaments and tournaments to circuits).\n   - Event does NOT have a winner indicated (need to find the property for winner and filter for events missing this property).\n\n**Step 1: Find the entity for \"men's singles\" tennis event.**", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"wikidata\",\"query\":\"men's singles tennis\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_azSeMVXffy5NG7WFKpu1v7oS", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1. men's singles, also known as men's singles in tennis (wd:Q16893072): instance of sports discipline, instance of competition class, instance of men's singles, discipline in tennis\n2. wheelchair tennis men's singles, also known as wheelchair men's singles (wd:Q50211922): competition class in wheelchair tennis, instance of competition class, instance of sports discipline, instance of men's singles\n3. all-time tennis records \u2013 men's singles, also known as all-time tennis records - men's singles, overall tennis records - men's singles, overall tennis records \u2013 men's singles (wd:Q17016846)\n4. 2011 Dubai Tennis Championships \u2013 men's singles (wd:Q1822061): 2011 tennis event results, instance of tennis event\n5. 2013 Sony Open Tennis \u2013 men's singles (wd:Q7724928): 2013 tennis event results, instance of tennis event\n6. 2023 Dubai Tennis Championships \u2013 Men's singles (wd:Q116897745): 2023 tennis event results, instance of tennis event\n7. 2022 Dubai Tennis Championships \u2013 men's singles (wd:Q110953898): 2022 tennis event results, instance of tennis event\n8. 2009 Dubai Tennis Championships \u2013 men's singles (wd:Q15262709): 2009 tennis event results, instance of tennis event\n9. 2020 Dubai Tennis Championships \u2013 men's singles (wd:Q85982068): 2020 tennis event results, instance of tennis event\n10. 2019 Dubai Tennis Championships \u2013 men's singles (wd:Q61856750): instance of tennis event, tennis tournament event", "tool_call_id": "call_azSeMVXffy5NG7WFKpu1v7oS"}, {"content": "The general entity for \"men's singles\" as a discipline or class is wd:Q16893072.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which deceased Canadian individuals have a FamilySearch person ID and have a father who does not have a FamilySearch person ID?

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the cultural heritage items located in Helsinki?

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who are the tennis players that are citizens of only Belgium?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Kennedy?"], "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a question answering assistant. Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4.

Please include their coordinates, the coordinates of the center point, and the distance from the center point."], "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a question answering assistant. Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which periodicals have a primary language of Esperanto?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the cities in Russia with a population exceeding 100,000?

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which items are manga chapters that are part of the \"Detective Conan\" series?

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the details of living authors who are citizens of the United States, were born in Massachusetts after 1919, including their birthplace and date of birth, ordered by their date of birth?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the distinct lithostratigraphic units located in Arizona?

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the details of all tennis tournaments that were part of the 2018 ATP World Tour?

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

For each result, return also its official website, coordinates (if available), and parent federated state."], "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a question answering assistant. Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which humans who were born in Australia or in any administrative territorial entity within Australia do not have a specified sex or gender?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

Exclude deprecated statements in your results."], "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a question answering assistant. Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

"content": "You are a question answering assistant. Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the items in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e d'art et d'histoire de Saint-Brieuc, along with the items of their creators, the items of the creators' places of birth in Brittany, their inventory numbers, and images (if available)?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question and identify the entities and properties involved:\n\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which items have an official website URL that contains the string \"twitter\"?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the distinct entities among South Korea, Norfolk Island, Wallis and Futuna, Tristan da Cunha, Christmas Island, and Gal\u00e1pagos Province, along with their population, area in square kilometers, and the date of the population data?

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What other items are owned by the owner of the merchant ship Edward John?

Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Include their developers, publishers, and publication dates, if available."], "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a question answering assistant. Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nwikidata at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/wikidata-sebastian with notes:\n1. For P39 legislative memberships, filter by pq:P2937 (legislative term) on the p:P39 statement; don\u2019t use P793 for term filtering. For UK MPs, avoid a generic Q16707842-only scan; rely on term qualifiers and proper date overlap on pq:P580/pq:P582.\n2. For residence (P551), time bounds are qualifiers on the statement: p:P551/ps:P551 place, pq:P580 start, pq:P582 end. To include containing areas (e.g., NYC boroughs), expand via wdt:P551/wdt:P131*. Durations usually need client-side calc on QLever.\n3. Ticker symbols are pq:P249 on p:P414 statements; query via the statement node (?org p:P414 ?st . ?st ps:P414 ?ex ; pq:P249 ?ticker). Use VALUES to pre-limit orgs/exchanges. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P249 on the org. Prefer qualifiers for time-bound tickers.\n4. Archives: use p:P485/ps:P485 for the holding institution. Inventory numbers are qualifiers pq:P217 on that P485 statement. Don\u2019t expect wdt:P217 directly on the person/work. \u201cArchive descriptions\u201d may be separate collection items (P195).\n5. When listing contained municipalities or similar, prefer wdt:P150* (has parts) from the parent to enumerate children, then join other relations (e.g., twin towns via wdt:P190). Avoid broad wdt:P131+ scans from children; they are slow and can timeout.\n6. On QLever, avoid SERVICE wikibase:label (frequent 301). Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters or fetch QIDs then labels separately. For property mapping, (?prop wikibase:directClaim ?p). Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts.\n7. Employer constraints: to find people employed by UN or international orgs, use wdt:P108 directly for UN (wd:Q1065), or traverse employer to part of (wdt:P361*) UN, or employer wdt:P31 wd:Q484652 (international organization). Combine with other occupations.\n8. For sports/events/editions, prefer explicit edition items (e.g., Q47345468) with wdt:P361 linking to the parent series/tour and filter by wdt:P585/P571 for year; avoid P641/P2139 that model sports played or participants, not the edition metadata.\n9. For author/creator queries, use occupation wdt:P106 (e.g., author/writer) rather than P31 typing. To list works, prefer the reverse path ^wdt:P50 ?work; P800 (notable work) is incomplete and curated, not a full bibliography.\n10. Awards: use p:P166/ps:P166 and constrain award via wdt:P31/wdt:P279* to a target class (e.g., Cannes awards Q28444913). Recipients can be films or people; don\u2019t assume film-specific properties exist. Count/group by recipient type if needed.\n11. To select current/active codes or memberships on QLever, use statement nodes (p:/ps:) and MINUS { ?st pq:P582 [] }. For time series counts (e.g., daily members), generate a date series (VALUES/UNNEST), then test overlap with pq:P580/pq:P582 per date.\n12. For people\u2019s native names, use wdt:P1559 (name in native language) on the person, not rdfs:label. Return multiple if multiple native languages exist; pick a preferred language client-side if needed.\n13. For multi-valued props (e.g., P1082), GROUP BY entity and aggregate (MAX/MIN/SAMPLE) to avoid duplicates; DISTINCT won\u2019t collapse multiple statements. For category/gender counts, prefer indicator sums: SUM(IF(cond,1,0)) over COUNT on OPTIONAL vars.\n14. Avoid SERVICE wikibase:label on QLever; it often 301s. Use OPTIONAL rdfs:label with LANG filters, or fetch QIDs first and labels in a follow-up. Pre-limit with subselect/VALUES to avoid timeouts when joining many labels.\n15. For P551 duration comparisons, avoid unsupported date arithmetic. If needed, compute overlaps client-side. On-endpoint, you can only compare presence/counts or use simple MIN/MAX of dates (casting and arithmetic are limited in QLever).\n16. When excluding specific entities from a relation (e.g., siblings), use FILTER to drop explicit QIDs or FILTER NOT EXISTS with a VALUES list. Ensure you use the exact sibling QIDs returned by the KG, not assumed ones.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. When checking date interval overlaps, handle open intervals (missing start/end) and use xsd:dateTime. Use OR conditions to cover start within, end within, or spanning the whole range.\n2. For P39 queries, qualifiers (e.g., P2937 term, P768 electoral district, P4100 parliamentary group) live on the p:P39 statement node. Do not expect them as wdt: properties on the person or use ps: for non-main values.\n3. To get sitelink counts, use wikibase:sitelinks on the entity; it returns a single numeric value, so GROUP BY the entity and avoid COUNT over ?sitelink.\n4. Use subclass expansion for types: wdt:P31/wdt:P279* target (e.g., dams, educational institutions). This captures items modeled with subclasses.\n5. For locations, prefer hierarchies via wdt:P131+ to reach a containing region/state, and wdt:P17 for country. If HQ is a building, P159 ps points to a city; specific site is qualifier pq:P276 on the P159 statement.\n6. When excluding or selecting by a legislative term on P39, check pq:P2937 on the relevant statement. Use FILTER NOT EXISTS over p:P39 with ps:P39 target and pq:P2937 value to exclude a term.\n7. QLever endpoints may not support Wikidata\u2019s \u201cWITH {\u2026} AS %name\u201d and \u201cINCLUDE %name\u201d syntax. Avoid named subqueries; use nested SELECTs or VALUES instead.\n8. The wikibase:label SERVICE often fails on QLever. Prefer rdfs:label with FILTER(LANG(..)=\"en\") or get QIDs only and resolve labels client-side.\n9. Avoid COUNT over OPTIONAL variables that may be unbound for all rows; prefer EXISTS/BOUND checks or aggregate over DISTINCT entities to prevent misleading zeros.\n10. On QLever, heavy OPTIONAL label/property joins often time out. Pre-limit with a subselect/VALUES over IDs (ORDER BY + LIMIT), then join labels/properties. Or fetch QIDs first and labels in a second, smaller query.\n11. For precise date filtering on Wikidata (birth/death), prefer p/psv time nodes and wikibase:timeValue plus timePrecision checks over wdt:P569/P570 to include values with year/month precision and avoid silent drops.\n12. When filtering by exact day of birth or event, avoid STRSTARTS on wdt:P569; instead bound an interval [day, next day) with xsd:dateTime to include all precisions. On QLever, add hint:Prior hint:rangeSafe true to improve performance on time ranges.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\ncc: <http://creativecommons.org/ns#\ndata: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeof: <http://www.opengis.net/def/function/geosparql/\nimdb: <https://www.imdb.com/\nmath: <http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#\nontolex: <http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\np: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/\npq: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/\npqn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value-normalized/\npqv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/qualifier/value/\npr: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/\nprn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value-normalized/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nprv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/reference/value/\nps: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/\npsn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value-normalized/\npsv: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/statement/value/\nqfn: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/function#\nql: <http://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/builtin-functions/\nqlss: <https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/spatialSearch/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nref: <http://www.wikidata.org/reference/\ns: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/statement/\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\nv: <http://www.wikidata.org/value/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdno: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/novalue/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwdtn: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct-normalized/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.
