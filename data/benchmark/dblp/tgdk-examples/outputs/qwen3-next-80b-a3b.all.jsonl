Then use that total in a second query to compute percentages.\n\n#### Step 4.1: Get the total count of publications with `dblp:bibtexType`\n\nLet\u2019s execute a simple query to get the total number of publications with a `dblp:bibtexType`:", "tool_calls": [{"id": "chatcmpl-tool-2a14a62d3a0546e4ba9ab0b1ebbb0065", "name": "execute", "args": {"kg": "dblp", "sparql": "SELECT (COUNT(?pub) AS ?total) WHERE { ?pub dblp:bibtexType ?subtype . }"}, "result": "Got 1 row and 1 column:\n| total             |\n| ----------------- |\n| 8101943 (xsd:int) |"}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 5509, "total_tokens": 5695}}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"id": "4cecf6fc678443ceb416fbd956c16216", "message": "The total number of publications with a `dblp:bibtexType` is **8,101,943**.\n\n#### Step 4.2: Now, write a query to get the count per subtype and manually compute percentages\n\nWe will now retrieve the count for each subtype and then compute the percentages externally (since we cannot use subqueries). However, since we must return a SPARQL query that gives the final answer, we can use a workaround: we can return the count per subtype and then calculate percentages in the answer.\n\nBut the instructions require that **all computation must be done within SPARQL**.

Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead.\n- Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n- The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n- Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n- Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4.

If the task input is incomplete or ambiguous, try to make reasonable assumptions and document them.\n- Do not use \"SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...\" in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead.\n- Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n- The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n- Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n- Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n- For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query."}, {"role": "user", "content": "All papers in dblp until 1940 with title, author name, and year of publication"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"id": "44106ad5e42a46e0b9b453e01f079a91", "message": "To answer the question, I need to find all papers in the DBLP knowledge graph published until 1940, along with their titles, author names, and years of publication.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the DBLP knowledge graph\nDBLP is a bibliographic database that contains information about scholarly publications, including papers, authors, and publication years.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions.

Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead.\n- Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n- The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n- Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n- Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n- For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query."}, {"role": "user", "content": "All papers published in SIGIR with title and publication year"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"id": "de2e4e1380134397a480c21ecef0f01e", "message": "To answer the question, \"All papers published in SIGIR with title and publication year,\" I need to find papers (articles) published in the SIGIR conference, along with their titles and publication years.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the DBLP knowledge graph\nDBLP (Digital Bibliography & Library Project) uses RDF schema to represent bibliographic data.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4.

Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead.\n- Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n- The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n- Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n- Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n- For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query."}, {"role": "user", "content": "All predicates ordered by size"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"id": "af01ebfc45024e9dbdc1e701cf49c865", "message": "To answer the question \"All predicates ordered by size,\" I need to determine what is meant by \"size.\" In the context of knowledge graphs, \"size\" could refer to the number of triples that use a particular predicate.

So I need to investigate whether \"stream\" is used as a label or a term in any of the properties or entities.\n\n### Step 2: Search for properties related to \"stream\"\nI will search for properties in DBLP that might be related to the term \"stream\".", "tool_calls": [{"id": "chatcmpl-tool-e1f0b90224634ce180077895602d96ea", "name": "search_property", "args": {"kg": "dblp", "query": "stream"}, "result": "Top 10 property alternatives:\n1. superStream (dblp:superStream): This stream has (or had) the other stream as a part. / is subproperty of relatedStream / has domain Stream / has range Stream\n2. subStream (dblp:subStream): This stream is (or was) a part of the other stream. / is subproperty of relatedStream / has domain Stream / has range Stream\n3. relatedStream (dblp:relatedStream): This stream is related to the other stream in some unspecified way. / has domain Stream / has range Stream\n4. publishedInStream (dblp:publishedInStream): The conference series, the journal, or the repository in which the publication has been published. / has domain Publication / has range Stream\n5. formerStreamTitle (dblp:formerStreamTitle): is subproperty of streamTitle / A former title of the stream. / has domain Stream\n6. streamTitle (dblp:streamTitle): A title of the stream. / has domain Stream\n7. primaryStreamTitle (dblp:primaryStreamTitle): The primary title of the stream. / is subproperty of streamTitle / has domain Stream\n8. homepage (dblp:homepage): The URL of an academic homepage of this creator. / is subproperty of webpage / has domain Creator\n9. type (rdf:type)\n10. url (<https://schema.org/url>)"}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 3357, "total_tokens": 3610}}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"id": "28df384489ef4787995ba9042c400dd1", "message": "Great!

It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n- Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n- Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n- For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Titles of all papers in dblp published until 1940, their authors with names, and the year of publication"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": {"id": "8f78193064e74fbebeff5032ef664b2e", "message": "To answer the question, I need to find all papers in the DBLP knowledge graph that were published until 1940, along with their titles, authors' names, and the year of publication.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of DBLP data\nDBLP uses the `dblp` namespace for its schema.

This might mean that DBLP does not explicitly assign these types as RDF types but instead uses other properties.\n\nLet me check if there are any triples where the object is one of the common publication types like `dblp:Article`, `dblp:Inproceedings`, etc., by searching for them explicitly.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "chatcmpl-tool-8dadfacf79fc40b0b1493f1588b15929", "name": "search_object_of_property", "args": {"kg": "dblp", "property": "rdf:type", "query": "Article"}, "result": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions.

Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead.\n- Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n- The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n- Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n- Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n- For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query."}, {"role": "user", "content": "All publications of Donald E.

Knuth's publications (titles, years, etc.) via `dblp:authoredBy`, but it does not include citation counts for those publications. The citation data exists in an external graph (OpenCitations) with different identifiers, and there is no direct way to link DBLP publications to their citation counts within the DBLP dataset.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to answer the question \"All publications of Donald E.
