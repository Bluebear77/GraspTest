Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Did Leedham, Graham and Wang, Lingyu co-author the paper 'A Thermal Hand Vein Pattern Verification System'?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8.

Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose.

Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the Wikidata ID of Offutt, A.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What papers did Hoppari, M. publish in VTC Spring and CoRR?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing.

For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who are the authors of the paper 'The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database' and what are their affiliations?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What publications did Chu K.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are the titles of the research papers on Overlay multicast that were published in International Conference on High Performance Computing in the year 2003?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "List the authors of 'Formal Metadata and Shared Experiences for Discovering Tools to Adapt Open Educational Resources' and their affiliations."}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Does Abdel Magid S.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2.

Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who are the authors that published research papers about Information systems in InfoSecCD in the year 2006?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n- We need to find authors who published research papers:\n  - about \"Information systems\"\n  - in the venue \"InfoSecCD\"\n  - in the year 2006\n\nStep 1: Identify how \"about Information systems\" is represented in DBLP.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Didn't the authors of the paper 'Functional Drift of Sequence Attributes in the FK506-Binding Proteins (FKBPs)' not not publish 'Multi-agent Pathfinding on Large Maps Using Graph Pruning: This Way or That Way?

Stearns publish in the last 3 years?"], "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a question answering assistant. Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which papers did the author Richard E.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Have Fernando M. and Ram\\u00F3n, \\.

Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples.

Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to link publications to authors. The inverse (author -> pubs) is not via dblp:author; queries with dblp:author typically return no results.\n2. Publication year is dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear). Avoid dblp:year. For last N years use YEAR(NOW()) in FILTER; use >= for inclusive bounds. Don\u2019t assume current year in prose. MIN/MAX work on gYear; avoid unnecessary casts.\n3. Venue is dblp:publishedIn (string like short name) and/or dblp:publishedInStream (entity IRI for series/journal/conference). For simple venue text, use dblp:publishedIn.\n4. To list an author\u2019s publications: SELECT ?pub WHERE { ?pub dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }. Then OPTIONAL get dblp:title, dblp:publishedIn, dblp:yearOfPublication.\n5. For yes/no authorship checks, use ASK with dblp:authoredBy, e.g., ASK { <pubIRI> dblp:authoredBy <authorIRI> }.\n6. Titles are via dblp:title on publication entities. rdfs:label often exists but is less reliable for titles; prefer dblp:title.\n7. If dblp:authoredBy on a pub yields a disambiguation author node (e.g., \u201c\u2026 (disambiguation)\u201d), treat it as the author IRI to use in joins; it still identifies the creator.\n8. Use dblp:createdBy as an alternative to dblp:authoredBy when authoredBy is missing; both link pubs to creators. Prefer authoredBy for authorship semantics.\n9. When filtering by venue names, dblp:publishedIn is a short string (e.g., \u2018WSC\u2019, \u2018ICALT\u2019, \u2018Gov. Inf. Q.\u2019). Avoid FILTER on ?pub IRI strings; filter on dblp:publishedIn value.\n10. Avoid rdf:type for pubs; rely on authoredBy/title/publishedIn/yearOfPublication. When counting, use COUNT(DISTINCT ?pub). For average per year, take AVG over yearly counts (subquery GROUP BY year); don\u2019t divide by year-span.\n11. Avoid using foaf:name/rdfs:label on creators for joins. Creators expose dblp:creatorName/primaryCreatorName and dblp:primaryAffiliation (string). Prefer joins on IRIs; fetch names/affiliations separately. Use SELECT DISTINCT ?author to dedup.\n12. When a SELECT returns no rows unexpectedly, check schema via search_property/search_property_of_entity or list the entity. Many failures stem from using wrong props (dblp:author vs dblp:authoredBy).\n13. Negations: avoid tautological NOT EXISTS. Prefer ASK { positive pattern } and invert in prose. For \u201calso published in V?\u201d, test other pubs by same authors and exclude the given pub via FILTER(?other != <pubIRI>) together with dblp:publishedIn 'V'.\n14. Avoid text search on titles with CONTAINS/LCASE for exact identification; prefer search_entity to get the record IRI, then query structured triples. After search_entity, verify exact title via dblp:title; don\u2019t pick a \u201cclosest match\u201d blindly.\n15. Be careful with complex ASK + FILTER combinations; QLever may error (CartesianProductJoin assertion). Simplify logic or split into separate queries to avoid engine bugs.\n16. For number of authors, prefer dblp:numberOfCreators when available; otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT ?a) over dblp:authoredBy.\n\nGeneral notes for all knowledge graphs:\n1. Normalize NL negations to a clear existential query. Prefer ASK { positive pattern }. For negated questions, evaluate the positive fact and invert only in prose. Avoid tautological or heavy NOT EXISTS patterns that can be slow or misleading.\n2. For relative time windows (\u201clast N years\u201d), always use YEAR(NOW()) in SPARQL and align inclusive/exclusive bounds with the question phrasing. Do not hardcode current year in answers; base the conclusion strictly on query results.\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.
