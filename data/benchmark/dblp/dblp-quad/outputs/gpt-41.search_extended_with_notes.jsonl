Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In 2016, how many papers did the authors of 'Cyber Incident Classifications Using Ontology-Based Knowledge Representation for Cybersecurity Insurance in Financial Industry' publish?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In which venues were the other publications published by the authors of 'The Development of a Realistic Simulation Framework with OMNeT++'?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8.

Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors.

Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors.

Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In 1997 in ASP-DAC, who are the authors that published papers about Decision diagrams?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n- We are looking for authors.\n- The papers must be published in 1997.\n- The venue is ASP-DAC (Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference).\n- The papers must be about \"Decision diagrams\".\n\nStep 1: Identify the entity for ASP-DAC in dblp.\nStep 2: Find the property for publication year (should be dblp:yearOfPublication).\nStep 3: Find how to filter for papers about \"Decision diagrams\" (likely in the title).\nStep 4: Retrieve the authors for those papers.\n\nLet's start by searching for the ASP-DAC venue entity in dblp.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"dblp\",\"query\":\"ASP-DAC\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_uht5nntsj1Szm2mso6Z42p0G", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What publications did Chu K.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Does Abdel Magid S.

For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mention the number of authors of 'Analysis of Low Hamming Weight Products' and 'A tiered planning strategy for biped navigation'."}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Didn't the authors of the paper 'Functional Drift of Sequence Attributes in the FK506-Binding Proteins (FKBPs)' not not publish 'Multi-agent Pathfinding on Large Maps Using Graph Pruning: This Way or That Way?

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Have Fernando M. and Ram\\u00F3n, \\.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Have the authors of the paper 'A Unifying Approach to Robust Convex Infinite Optimization Duality' not not published the paper 'Differential Virtual Instrumentation with Continuously'?"}, {"content": "Let's break down the question:\n\n- The question is asking if the authors of the paper \"A Unifying Approach to Robust Convex Infinite Optimization Duality\" have NOT NOT published the paper \"Differential Virtual Instrumentation with Continuously\".\n- The double negative \"not not\" means we are being asked if they HAVE published the second paper.\n\nSo, the question is: Have the authors of \"A Unifying Approach to Robust Convex Infinite Optimization Duality\" published \"Differential Virtual Instrumentation with Continuously\"?\n\nStep-by-step plan:\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.
