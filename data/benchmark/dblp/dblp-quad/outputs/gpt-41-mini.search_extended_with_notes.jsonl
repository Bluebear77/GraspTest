Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Did Leedham, Graham and Wang, Lingyu co-author the paper 'A Thermal Hand Vein Pattern Verification System'?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, I need to verify if there is a publication titled \"A Thermal Hand Vein Pattern Verification System\" that has both Leedham, Graham and Wang, Lingyu as co-authors.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10.

The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp.

Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10.

Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp.

Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions.

Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\ndblp at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/dblp with notes:\n1. Use dblp:authoredBy to reliably link publications to authors. Query from the publication side for author-publication relationships, as direct links from author entities may be incomplete or missing.\n2. dblp:publishedIn and dblp:publishedInStream are both used for venues; publishedIn can be a string or entity, while publishedInStream is always an entity. Prefer publishedInStream when available for reliable venue queries.\n3. For publication year, use dblp:yearOfPublication (xsd:gYear) from the publication entity. The property dblp:year is often missing or unreliable.\n4. SPARQL queries with GROUP BY, LIMIT, ORDER BY, or aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, AVG) may not work as expected in dblp. Retrieve all grouped results and post-process to find min/max/avg or desired ordering.\n5. Publication titles and venue labels may be inconsistently present (dc:title, rdfs:label, schema:name, dblp:title). Use OPTIONAL for all likely properties. If data is missing, use the list function to inspect all properties for alternatives.\n6. When searching for authors or venues, multiple candidates may be returned. Use additional context (e.g., co-authors, publication titles, years) to disambiguate and select the correct entity.\n7. For venue queries, try both entity IRIs (e.g., streams) and string literals, as some publications may only be linked via one or the other. Consider using FILTER or UNION to cover both cases.\n8. For negative authorship or publication existence queries, use FILTER NOT EXISTS in ASK queries to check for the absence of a relationship (e.g., not authored by a specific person).\n9. dblp:title is an additional property for publication titles. If dc:title, rdfs:label, or schema:name are missing, check dblp:title as it may contain the full or canonical title.\n10. Affiliation data (e.g., primaryAffiliation) for authors is often missing or unreliable in dblp. Queries about author institutions or collaborations based on affiliation may not yield results or may require external validation.\n\nNo general notes for all knowledge graphs available\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nbibtex: <http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#\ncito: <http://purl.org/spar/cito/\ndatacite: <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/\ndblp: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema#\ndblps: <https://dblp.org/rdf/schema-2020-07-01#\nliteral: <http://purl.org/spar/literal/\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\nterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\nwd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/\nwdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Search for the entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Execute intermediate queries to get feedback and to verify your assumptions. You may need to refine or rethink your current plan based on the query results and go back to step 2 if needed, possibly multiple times.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not just use or make up entity or property identifiers without verifying their existence in the knowledge graphs first.\n3. Always execute your final SPARQL query before giving an answer to make sure it returns the expected results.\n4. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n5. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n6. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n7. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n8. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Didn't the authors of the paper 'A complete proof of global exponential convergence of a neural network for quadratic optimization with bound constraints' publish 'Application of Genetic Algorithms for a Tyre Production Scheduling Information System'?"}, {"content": "Step 1: Identify the paper \"A complete proof of global exponential convergence of a neural network for quadratic optimization with bound constraints\" in the dblp knowledge graph to find its authors.\n\nStep 2: Identify the paper \"Application of Genetic Algorithms for a Tyre Production Scheduling Information System\" in the dblp knowledge graph.\n\nStep 3: Check if there is any overlap in authors between the two papers.\n\nI will start by searching for the first paper to find its authors.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"dblp\",\"query\":\"A complete proof of global exponential convergence of a neural network for quadratic optimization with bound constraints\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_R9jX8CcmDobh1Y3hg5eQb1bl", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.
